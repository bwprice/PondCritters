This simple website aims to provide help identifying the major invertebrate groups you are likely to encounter during a pond dip. Not all groups are covered yet.


## Health & Safety
It's important to pond dip safely:

1. Make sure you've done a risk assessment.
2. Never pond dip alone, you might need help. 
3. Wear gloves and wash your hands when done - *you don't have to sing happy birthday*
4. Make sure to cover any cuts.
5. Be on the lookout for symptoms of **Weils disease**, more info on the [NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/leptospirosis/)


## How to pond dip
It's as simple as it sounds - grab a net and dip it into the pond! Make sure you:
1. Gently scrape up against any vegetation.
2. Get some of the bottom leaves, sticks and mud into the net.
3. Clean the contents by dipping the net into the water several times.

The most important thing is to keep the water going into the net, **DONâ€™T MOVE IT BACKWARDS** or everything you've just caught will fall out the front! 

Pond critters can be quite fast so you'll need to keep the water flowing into the net, or lift the net out of the water.

## **POND INVERTEBRATES**
Below you will find videos and key features of the major groups you are likely to find in a pond dip.
I've split them into three groups:

1. [No legs](#no-legs)
2. [Six legs](#six-legs)
3. [More than six legs](#more-than-six-legs)

***Note:** Insects have six segmented legs, but fly larvae don't have any real legs - if in doubt check out the insect Order [Diptera](#flies-order-diptera)*

# NO LEGS


### Flatworms (Phylum: Platyhelminthes)
- Usually quite small (1-3cm)
- Glide across the bottom
- Predators / scavangers

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="O040Jd3yzhM" %}

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="7UyJW4LfsWI" %}


**Leeches (subclass: Hirudinea)**

# SIX LEGS


## **INSECTS (Phylum: Arthropoda, Class: Insecta)**
*Insects comprise the group with the most species so they are divided by Order below.*

Distinguishing features:
- Six legs, except [fly](#flies-order-diptera) larvae
- Segmented body (head, thorax, abdomen)


### Dragonflies & Damselflies (Order: Odonata)
*Almost everyone thinks of dragonflies as masters of the sky, but they spend most of their lives underwater where they are the dominant predators in fishless ecosystems!*

**Dragonflies**
- Large and stout (up to 5cm)
- Use waterjet propulsion (i.e. don't swim)
- No "tail paddles" but can have short spines
- Voracious predators

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="UMXoh2u1cr0" %}


**Damselflies**
- Large and slender (up to 3cm)
- Swim with a side-to-side motion
- 3 "tail paddles" - these are gills
- Voracious predators

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="h0GnDxugNY0" %}


### True Bugs (Order: Hemiptera)
*Bugs look quite similar as adults and larvae as they don't have a pupal stage.* 
Several different bug families are aquatic, the most common are:

**Pond skaters (Family: Gerridae)**
- Walk on the water surface
- Long slender legs

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="GEYXF4fXjrk" %}


**Water boatmen (Family: Corixidae)**
- Streamlined elongated body
- Swim the right way up
- Very fast swimmers
- A pair of long oar-shaped legs

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="LNXLKEr6zFM" %}


**Backswimmers (Family: Notonectidae)**
- Streamlined elongated body
- Swim upside down
- A pair of long oar-shaped legs

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="RQ-3OC6fHm0" %}


### Beetles
*Unlike bugs, beetle larvae look very different to the adults and both can be found in a pond*

**Larvae**
- Worm-like shape
- Six segmented legs
- Distinct head is usually visible

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="a4xCXndZ7l4" %}


**Adults**
- Robust body, round rather than long
- Hardened case covers wings
- Very active (difficult to catch)

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="LXRijDuF-2A" %}
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="O0uNbzsceZE" %}


### Mayflies (Order: Ephemeroptera)
*In most British ponds you will likely find a single species: Cloeon dipterum - the "pond olive"*

- Three tails (sometimes broken)
- Gills along the side of the abdomen
- Delicate, but they move quickly to escape capture

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="0S5BDxx_9j4" %}


### Caddisflies (Order: Trichoptera)
*Caddisflies are the freshwater relatives of moths. Some species make cases out of sticks, leaves, sand grains or silk.*

- Worm-like shape
- Six prominent legs
- Two strong hooks at end of abdomen
- Head and thorax well distinguished
- Some carry a case (not all species)

**Cased caddisfly**
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="YTjK2ZUD8Vk" %}

**Caseless caddisfly**
{% include youtubePlayer.html id="iAJkBTmsCjY" %}


### Flies (Order: Diptera)
*Flies are the most species rich freshwater invertebrate group, with over 3000 species in the UK alone!*

**Craneflies (Family: Tabanidae)**

*These flies have unmistakable large adults, known as "daddy longlegs."* 

- Soft worm-like body
- Large anal spiracles (breathing holes)
- Protuberances on final segment

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="2QqAcu8KEWs" %}


**Phantom Midges (Family: Chaoboridae)**

*The fly equivalent of a submarine!*

- Nearly transparent
- Float in the water column (i.e. not on the surface or bottom)
- Antennae modified into grasping organs (like the raptorial arms of a mantis!)

{% include youtubePlayer.html id="1HUBvGVa8GI" %}


**Non-biting Midges (Family: Chironomidae)**

*A diverse group in which the adults look like mosquitos.*

- Distinct head
- Sometimes bright red
- Prolegs just behind head
