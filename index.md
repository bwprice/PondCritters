This simple website aims to provide help identifying the major invertebrate groups you are likely to encounter during a pond dip. Not all groups are covered yet..


## Health & Safety
It's important to pond dip safely:
1. Make sure you've done a risk assessment.
2. Never pond dip alone, you might need help. 
3. Wear gloves and wash your hands when done - you don't have to sing happy birthday!
4. Make sure to cover any cuts.
5. Be on the lookout for symptoms of Weils disease, more info at the [NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/leptospirosis/)


## How to pond dip
It's as simple as it sounds - grab a net and dip it into the pond! Make sure you:
1. Gently scrape up against any vegetation.
2. Get some of the bottom leaves, sticks and mud into the net.
3. Clean the contents by dipping the net into the water several times.

The most important thing is to keep the water going into the net, **DONâ€™T MOVE IT BACKWARDS** or everything you've just caught will fall out the front! 

Pond critters can be quite fast so you'll need to keep the water flowing into the net, or lift the net out of the water.

Here is a short video showing you a simple pond dip!
