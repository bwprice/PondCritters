## Health & Safety
It's important to pond dip safely:
1. Always make sure you've done a comprehensive risk assessment before beginning.
2. Never pond dip alone, you might need help. 
3. Whenever working with water samples you should use gloves and wash your hands when done.
4. Make sure to cover any scrapes / grazes or cuts.
5. Be on the lookout for symptoms of Weils disease, more info at the [NHS website](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/leptospirosis/)


## How to pond dip
It's as simple as it sounds - grab a net and dip it into the pond! Make sure you scrape up against any submerged vegetation or overhanging vegetation on the sides and get some of the bottom leaves and silt in the net.

The most important thing is to keep the water going into the net, DONâ€™T MOVE IT BACKWARDS or everything you've just caught will fall out the front! Pond critters can be quite fast so you'll need to keep the water flowing into the net, or lift the net out of the water.

Here is a short video showing you a simple pond dip!
